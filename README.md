# stat-4185-final-project-patturi
This is my final project for STAT 4185: Advanced Data Manipulation and Analysis With Python
For this project, a question that I wanted to answer is which economic factors are most strongly correlated to the quality of life ranking of a country? To ultimately arrive at an answer to the question, I followed the data science pipeline. During the Data Collection stage, I used the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the web. During the Data Cleaning stage, I utilized pandas to clean the data. During the Data Visualization stage, I used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to generate visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to visualize the correlations. Finally, I used scikit-learn to generate data models. All of my work can be found in the jupyter notebook that has been uploaded to this repository. 
I got my data from the following source: https://take-profit.org/en/statistics/quality-of-life/
