# stat-4185-final-project-patturi
This is my final project for STAT 4185: Advanced Data Manipulation and Analysis With Python
For this project, a question that I wanted to answer is which economic factors are most strongly correlated to the quality of life ranking of a country? To ultimately arrive at an answer to the question, I followed the data science pipeline. During the Data Collection stage, I used the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the web. During the Data Cleaning stage, I utilized pandas to clean the data. During the Data Visualization stage, I used libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to generate visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to visualize the correlations. Finally, I used scikit-learn to generate data models and find the most important economic features that are affect the quality of life the most in the countries that are sampled. All of my work can be found in the .ipynb file that has been uploaded to this repository. This file can be run in Jupyter Notebook. 
I got my data from the following source: https://take-profit.org/en/statistics/quality-of-life/
